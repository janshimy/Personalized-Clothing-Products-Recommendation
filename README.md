# Recommender System with Deep Learning and Computer Vision
In this project, I implement a Recommender System with Deep Learning and Computer Vision. 
My approach involved a series of steps that included loading image data, using #OpenCV for image preprocessing and transformations, 
and utilizing the Deep Learning #Xception architecture to extract key features from the product image. 
By computing cosine similarity between the reference/query image and other images, we were able to display the top similar products.

We also show a sample of future extractor based on Reksidual Network(ResNet34) structure applied on face classification use case.
